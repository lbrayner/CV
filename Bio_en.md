With more than 7 years of full-stack experience with Jakarta EE, I have also
throughout been responsible for the build process and managed the IT
infrastructure, which brought me closer to Python and Shell/Bash Script (mostly
the latter). I contributed to and lead the development of a human resources
management system aimed at the public sector with Jakarta EE.
