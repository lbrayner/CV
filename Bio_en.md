# Profile

With more than 7 years of full-stack experience with Jakarta EE, I have also
throughout been responsible for the build process and managed the IT
infrastructure, which brought me closer to Python and Shell/Bash Script (mostly
the latter). I contributed to and lead the development of a human resources
management system aimed at the public sector with Jakarta EE.

I have overseen Spring Boot + Angular projects which make use of Domain-driven
Design techniques, such as Hexagonal Architecture and Command Query
Responsibility Segregation (CQRS).

I have developed and maintained several features (full-stack) to a human
resources management system, which comprise: queries e data manipulation (JPA w/
Hibernate, MySQL); data persistence (JPA w/ Hibernate, MySQL); user interfaces
with JSF; reports with JasperReports; data export and manipulation with Groovy.
