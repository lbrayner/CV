With more than 7 years of full-stack experience with Jakarta EE (JPA/Hibernate +
PostgreSQL, JSF, Groovy), I have also throughout been responsible for the build
process (Apache Maven) and managed the IT infrastructure (Linux servers, BIND,
iptables, nftables, Apache HTTP Server, Subversion, Samba, OpenVPN), which
brought me closer to Python and Shell/Bash Script (mostly the latter). I
contributed to and lead the development of a human resources management system
aimed at the public sector with Jakarta EE. I'm a Vim, Unix, suckless software,
window managers, Emacs, and free software enthusiast. I'm interested in
functional programming and Lisp.

### Systems analyst team lead since June 2020

I have designed and implemented a Jakarta EE (+JPA w/ Hibernate, PostgreSQL,
Groovy) web service client to exchange complex municipal civil service staff
data with federal administrative bodies.

I have overseen Spring Boot + Angular projects which make use of Domain-driven
Design techniques, such as Hexagonal Architecture and Command Query
Responsibility Segregation (CQRS).

I have concomitantly maintained the IT infrastructure (Linux servers, BIND,
iptables, nftables, Apache HTTP Server, Subversion, Samba, OpenVPN).

### Senior systems analyst for 3 **years**

I have designed and implemented a Jakarta EE (+JPA w/ Hibernate, PostgreSQL,
Groovy) module that exports complex structured municipal civil service staff
data to state administrative bodies.

I have designed and implemented a Jakarta EE (+JPA w/ Hibernate, PostgreSQL)
data migration application that works with any data source — the target is JPA.

I have concomitantly maintained the IT infrastructure (Linux servers, BIND,
iptables, nftables, Apache HTTP Server, Subversion, Samba, OpenVPN).

### Java developer for 2 **years**

I have developed and maintained several features (full-stack) to a human
resources management system, which comprise: queries e data manipulation (JPA w/
Hibernate, MySQL); data persistence (JPA w/ Hibernate, MySQL); user interfaces
with JSF; reports with JasperReports; data export and manipulation with Groovy.

I have concomitantly maintained the IT infrastructure (Linux servers, BIND,
iptables, nftables, Apache HTTP Server, Subversion, Samba, OpenVPN).
